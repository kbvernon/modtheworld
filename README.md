# Modeling the World with R

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

This repository hosts the source code for **“Modeling the World with
R”**, a book that introduces readers to the fundamentals of statistics
and statistical programming in R.

Couple things to note:

1.  This book is still being written.  
2.  It is designed for a classroom setting, not for the casual reader.
    In fact, I am hesitant to call it a “book” at all.  
3.  It is primarily geared toward students who have some proficiency
    with basic statistical concepts. In the United States, that would be
    advanced undergraduates and beginning graduate students.
