# Welcome {-}

This is the website for __"Modeling the World with R"__, a book that introduces readers to the fundamentals of statistics and statistical programming in R.  

<img src="images/book_cover.png" width="315" height="315" align="right" style="margin: 0 1em 0 1em" />

While geared toward practical applications, like analyzing and visualizing data, this book aims to promote higher-order understanding of statistical concepts and theory too - not just the _how_, but the _why_. The reader will, thus, come away with a better sense of statistical _relevance_; meaning, they will be able to start with a scientific question, translate it into a more precise statistical form, identify the _appropriate_ statistical methods, and then use the statistical programming tools offered by R to implement those methods efficiently. In a word, then, the book aims to make the reader a more efficient and more thoughtful empirical _modeler_.  

The book is also free and open source, licensed under the Creative Commons ...
