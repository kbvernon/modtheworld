# Modeling the World with R

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

This repository hosts the source code for __"Modeling the World with R"__, a book that introduces readers to the fundamentals of statistics and statistical programming in R.

Couple things to note:  

1. This book is still being written.    
2. It is designed for a classroom setting, not for the casual reader. In fact, I am hesitant to call it a "book" at all.   
3. It is primarily geared toward students who have some proficiency with basic statistical concepts. In the United States, that would be advanced undergraduates and beginning graduate students.
