Often times, getting your data ready for analysis will require you to transform it in one way or another, though not, of course, in ways that would imply you are cooking the books! To explore the various tools R provides for doing this, we'll return again to our penguins data.

```{r, render = function(x, ...){ print(x) }}

penguins <- read.csv("penguins.csv")

str(penguins)

```

## Order table 

Suppose we want to re-arrange the rows of our penguins data by sorting in terms of body mass. Ideally, base R would provide us a function that takes a data.frame as input, along with a specification of which variable or variables should be used to re-order rows, and return the re-ordered data.frame as output. Unfortunately, that does not exist, not in base R anyway. So, ordering a data.frame requires some finagling. Specifically, you need to create an _index vector_ of the re-ordered rows and apply that to the data.frame. In this case, the sorting vector needs to have a length equal to the number of rows in the table. This is because we are not subsetting or filtering the rows, but simply returning them in a different order. To create such a vector, we use the `order()` function, passing it the variable we want to order the table with. It is probably easiest to see how `order()` works by first considering a vector of un-ordered letters.

```{r}

unordered_letters <- c("b", "d", "e", "a", "c")

(i <- order(unordered_letters))

```

The vector `order()` returns here is a vector of numeric positions. These numeric positions line up with the letters in the `unordered_letters` vector like so:

* `4` refers to `"a"` 
* `1` refers to `"b"`, 
* `5` refers to `"c"`, 
* `2` refers to `"d"`, and 
* `3` refers to `"e"`. 

We can, thus, use the result of `order()` to put the letters of `unordered_letters` into their proper alphabetic order.

```{r}

unordered_letters[i]

```

When applied to a variable in a table, the numeric positions returned are also the row numbers. Hence, we can use the result of `order()` to re-arrange rows in a table by the specified variable.

```{r, render = function(x, options) { print(x) }}

# create index vector
row_order <- order(penguins$body_mass_g)

row_order[1:5]

order_penguins <- penguins[row_order, ]

head(order_penguins)

```

Note, that you can order by increasing (`decreasing = FALSE`) or decreasing (`increasing = TRUE`) values of the variable. 

```{r, render = function(x, options) { print(x) }}

row_order  <- order(penguins$body_mass_g, decreasing = TRUE)

order_penguins <- penguins[row_order , ]

head(order_penguins)

```

You can also order a table by multiple variables.

```{r}

row_order <- order(penguins$species,
                   penguins$island,
                   penguins$body_mass_g)

order_penguins <- penguins[row_order , ]

head(order_penguins)

```


## Combine tables 

You will often find yourself wanting to combine multiple tables together. Sometimes this is because of the way that you collected data in the field, like having multiple forms with multiple tables that make data collection easier. Other times it is probably owing to the fact that you collected some data, then someone else collected some more, and now you need to put the two together. There are two primary ways to do this in R. Which one you should use depends on the circumstances of your data.  

* If you have two tables with the __same variables__ but __new observations__, then you will combine the observations or rows of each table together. If you had, for example, gone out a year or two after the initial phases of penguins data collection and measured the same variables as before (flipper length, bill length, and body mass), you would want to ensure that the newly measured values remain _bound_ to the same variables in your original table. This is achieved with `rbind()`.  
* If you have two tables with __new variables__ but the __same observations__, then you will combine the variables or columns of each table together. If you had, for example, identified the same penguins during the same years as in the initial phases of penguin data collection and, say, measured their heights in centimeters and the size of their feet in millimeters, you would want to ensure that these values are _bound_ to the same penguins in the same years as your other variables. This is achieved  with `cbind()`.  
 
```{r, eval = FALSE}

penguins <- rbind(penguins, new_observations)

penguins <- cbind(penguins, new_variables)

```


## Change variable  

Sometimes you will want to change the values of a variable. The simple, friendly way to do this involves the `transform()` function. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}

# single variable
penguins <- transform(penguins, 
                      body_mass_g = body_mass_g * 10)

# multiple variables
penguins <- transform(penguins, 
                      body_mass_g = scale(body_mass_g),
                      bill_length_mm = scale(bill_length_mm),
                      flipper_length_mm = scale(flipper_length_mm))

```

```{block2 transform_scoping, type = "rmdnote"}
As with `subset()`, you do not have to quote variable names when referring to them within the `transform()` function. Again, this is because R knows that you are referring to the variables within the specified table.  
```

You can achieve the same result with the `[` and `$` operators, though in a less elegant way, especially for multiple variables.  

```{r, eval = FALSE}

# bracket operator
penguins[ , "body_mass_g"] <- scale(penguins$body_mass_g)
penguins[ , "bill_length_mm"] <- scale(penguins$bill_length_mm)
penguins[ , "flipper_length_mm"] = scale(penguins$flipper_length_mm)

# dollar operator
penguins$body_mass_g <- scale(penguins$body_mass_g)
penguins$bill_length_mm <- scale(penguins$bill_length_mm)
penguins$flipper_length_mm = scale(penguins$flipper_length_mm)

```


## Add variable

The `transform()` function also allows you to append new variables to your table. This is most useful when you want to use other variables in the table to define a new variable. For instance, if we wanted to find the ratio of bill length to body mass for each individual penguin and add that ratio as a new column, we could do this:

```{r}

original_variables <- names(penguins)

# add ratio variable
penguins <- transform(penguins, 
                      ratio_bill_mass = bill_length_mm / body_mass_g)

new_variables <- names(penguins)

setdiff(new_variables, original_variables)

```

The `setdiff()` function (short for _set difference_) here is simply asking for the names of variables in the modified penguins table that are _not_ in the original penguins table, so this is just a way of showing that we have in fact added a new variable.  

As above, you can achieve the same result with the `[` and `$` operators, though again in a far less friendly way.

```{r}

penguins$ratio_bill_mass <- penguins$bill_length_mm / penguins$body_mass_g

penguins[ , "body_mass_zs"] <- penguins$bill_length_mm / penguins$body_mass_g

```

Using these subset operators can get exceptionally tedious when you want to add many new variables based on values of the original variables.

```{r}

new_penguins <- transform(penguins, 
                          ratio_bill_mass = bill_length_mm / body_mass_g,
                          ratio_bill_fipper = bill_length_mm / flipper_length_mm,
                          normalized_body_mass = body_mass_g / max(body_mass_g))

setdiff(names(new_penguins), names(penguins))

```



## Aggregate factors

Suppose you want to know the mean body mass of penguins _on each island_ or the median bill length _of each species_. To find these values, you need a way of summarizing your data relative to one or more groups. To achieve this, R provides the `aggregate()` function. This is a powerful, albeit quirky, function. The parameters you will mosty likely interact with on a regular basis are these:  

* `data` = the data.frame containing the variable you want to summarize,  
* `formula` = an R formula of the form `y ~ c1 + c2` that specifies the variable (`y`) to be summarized as a function of one or more factor variables (`c1`, `c2`, ..., `cn`), and   
* `FUN` = the R function that you use to compute the summary statistic.  

As a simple case, consider the scenario where we want to get mean body mass for each island.

```{r, render = function(x, options) { print(x) }}

aggregate(formula = (body_mass_g ~ island),
          data = penguins,
          FUN = mean)

```

And median bill length of each species.

```{r, render = function(x, options) { print(x) }}

aggregate(formula = (bill_length_mm ~ species),
          data = penguins,
          FUN = median)

```

And, finally, mean body mass for each species on each island.

```{r, render = function(x, options) { print(x) }}

aggregate(formula = (body_mass_g ~ island + species),
          data = penguins,
          FUN = mean)

```
